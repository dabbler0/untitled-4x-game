# Untitled 4x Game

This game lacks both a title and any concrete ambitions to existence. To the extent that it wants to exist, it wants to be "Stellaris on a hex grid" with a twist. The twist is that players should have different victory conditions from each other, base don their ethics, that are sometimes simultaneously satisfiable (so that there can be multiple non-aligned victors); the hope is that this would encourage roleplay. The current substance of this game was cobbled together during a feverish haze over a weekend and will likely not expand until the next time I am sick. Vague roadmap:
